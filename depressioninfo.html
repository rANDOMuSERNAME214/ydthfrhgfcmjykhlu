    <p> Depression, huh? Yikes. That's nasty stuff. Now, I haven't ever been depressed, neither do I know anyone
        who is or has been, so all I'm saying is, take my advice with a pinch of salt. Check <a href=legalnotice.html>Legal Notice</a>
        for reference. Anyways, most of the time, depression has a cause. Whether it's pressure, expectations you
        cannot possibly keep up with, <a href="stressinfo.html">stress</a>, or maybe even hormonal changes in 
        adolescents, figuring out these causes is a key part in overcoming depression. Depression is like a fart, it
        can sneak up on anyone, and while some people can hide it really well, it is very apparent in some. And 
        if you think I'm trying to make the situation sound less serious than it really is, that's because I am. I'm 
        trying to cheer you depressed folks up, so some gratitude please. 
    </p>
    <p> Now you must be thinking, "How do we know 
        if we have depression?" Well, it's in the name. Depression is when you feel depressed. That's it. That's the 
        whole article. You can go to bed now. But I kid. Depression has quite a few symptoms actually, not just the
        one. Aside from constantly feeling down, depressed people can also feel fatigued, feelings of guilt, hopelessness,
        worthlessness, helplessness, emptiness, anxiousness, restlessness, crankiness, irritability, a sense of despair,a 
        loss of appetite, and mild insomnia. Now, if this sounds like a lot, it is. Fortunately for all you depresso esspressos
         out there, depression only includes some of these symptoms. Now, don't go calling yourself depressed if you're not hungry,
        we have doctors for that. This article is about treating depression, not identifying it, so let me get that clear.
    </p>
    <p> Doctors send you through a physical examination, ask you about symptoms, severity, and if mental illnesses run in 
        the family, because depression is know to run in families. So, if your relatives are happy, you probably will be
        too. The most common form of depression is known as clinical depression. Doesn't sound too bad, right?<a href=https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/major-depression> Except it's 
        also called Major Depression.</a> Now, the "clinical" way to treat "clinical" depression (see what I did there?)
        is either physician-prescribed antidepressants, which help your body produce more dopamine(hormones which make
        us feel pleasure) and keep you happy, or a special kind of therapy called psychotherapy.
    </p>
    <p> No? Don't wanna visit the doctor? Well, I would recommend you do, but it's your personal choice, you do you.
        Anyways, it's your friendly neighbourhood Problem Solver to the rescue. Now, if you want to be completely cured
        of depression, <u>go to therapy</u>. But if you don't want to feel a lot of the above-mentioned symptoms,
        I can help. Remember how I said figuring out the cause of your depression was important? Here's how. Suppose
        you're really stressed. Too much work piling on your shoulders, too much paperwork to fill, and really short deadlines.
        This can cause depression too, and one way to treat this is to take a break. All those leaves you've saving for 
        the end of the year? Spend a week. Relax. Take a vacation. You can even slowly finish all your pending work.
        But the best option is to <u>find a new job</u>. Don't immediately give in your 2 weeks. Instead, spend time trying to scout
        out new jobs and updating your resumee and whatnot, but maybe I'm delving too deep into this example. Another 
        way to help is to surround yourself with friends. And I don't mean pick a random person off the street and call
        them your friend, I mean make friends that you can relate to, someone who you like to be around, but most importantly,
        someone who knows what you are worth. You can also do things you love. Gardening, meditating, yoga, anything peaceful,
        really. Or if you're a daredevil who likes risking your life clinging on the sides of mountains, you can do that 
        too, I guess.

    <p>Aaaaaand looks like that's time. Thank you guys, you've been a great audience. If you've got any hate towards this 
        article, feel free to send an email to <a href="scam.com">totallyarealemailaddress@gmail.com</a>. But seriously, 
        I really hope this helps those of you out in the crowd who needed it, and I'm happy to help, if i hopefully have.
        Now go to bed, it's past your bedtime.
